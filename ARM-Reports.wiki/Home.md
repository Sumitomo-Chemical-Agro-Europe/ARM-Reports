# SCAE User guide â€“ Creation of a report from ARM .dat file





The user guide will help to understand how the future report extracted from ARM will be created.  
Most of the content will come automatically from ARM and will be sorted out according to the Sumitomo set built by SCAE. However, some actions remain to be done manually by the author of the report (these are identified in this guide).
